# papermerge
Papermerge docker-compose and configuration files. To be used with my docker images.

These files are general templates provided as-is and thus need to be adjusted withe your own share paths and configuration data.

You can adjust the default language in the papermerge.[app/worker].config.py files with your desired language i.e.:

OCR_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE = "deu"

Adjust all the your[dbname/dbusername/dbpassword] values with your own.
